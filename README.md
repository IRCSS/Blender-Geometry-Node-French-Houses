Procedural French Style Architecture in Geometry nodes Blender 5.0
=================
This repo contains nodes for a procedural mesh generation of french style architecture. It was written and tested on Blender 5.0. The test machine has a 5090 graphic card, alot of ram and a powerful CPU, so the performance on lower end PCs could be very different compared to the videos.

The nodes are well documented and cleaned up, with viewer nodes in betweens to be able to follow whats happening. At a later date I will release a blog post explaining some of the tricks more in depth.
